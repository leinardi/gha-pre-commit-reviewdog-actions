# Runs the script tests: lib/*.test.sh (the pass runner, the snapshot library, the reviewdog
# installer) and each <action>/*.test.sh, one after the other, and fails if any of them fails or
# if there is none at all. Each test file is self-contained: it stubs the commands it needs
# (pre-commit, reviewdog, curl, ...) on PATH, uses real git only in temporary repositories, and
# never touches the network.
#
# Untracked test files are included (but not ignored ones), so a new test runs before its first
# commit.
